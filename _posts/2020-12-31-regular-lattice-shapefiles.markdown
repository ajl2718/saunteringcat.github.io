For a project a while ago I wanted to create shapefiles of regular lattices (as opposed to the SA1 / SA2 boundaries that often are used in Austraila). I created two notebooks to go through these: 
- The first to create the shapefiles
- The second to do the transformation of data in one geometry to another (by taking a weighted average over intersecting polygons).

They are available [here](https://github.com/alex2718/python_learning/blob/master/HexGrid.ipynb), [here](https://github.com/alex2718/python_learning/blob/master/RegularGridShapefiles.ipynb) and [here](https://github.com/alex2718/python_learning/blob/master/UniformPopulationEstimates.ipynb).
