I am currently a Research Fellow in Cancer Services and Data Science at the University of Melbourne. My research focuses on applications of machine learning and statistical methods to linked health services data in order to improve cancer survivorship.

This blog is less related to my academic research and more to general tech, programming and data topics. It is really just a place to record some interesting things I have learnt about. I find it helpful to write up what I learn about in order to test and clarify my own understanding and hopefully some of these articles will be useful for others too. 

My background is in maths and physics and I completed my PhD back in 2015. Since then I have worked in a range of data science roles: as a Data Scientist at [VCDI] leading data science projects that address government data challenges; a signal processing researcher at [DST Group] and as an analyst at [Gapmaps]. My main interests are in health analytics, machine learning and statistics, but I also enjoy occasionally tinkering with open data.

A couple of open source projects I have led:

- [Loupe]: a Python package for detecting and redacting Personally Identifiable Information (PII) from text to faciliate data sharing;
- [PhraseGeocoder]: a geocoding package built using Python and PostgreSQL for Australian street addresses, based on recent research on record linkage algorithms. 

I also enjoy mountains, cycling, cooking eggplant, reading and music.
