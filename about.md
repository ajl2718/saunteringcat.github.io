I am currently a Research Fellow in Cancer Services and Data Science at the University of Melbourne specialising in health analytics using linked data.

Since completed my PhD in Mathematics in 2015 I have gained a fairly broad range of experiences across the data world: previously I have worked as a Data Scientist at [VCDI], a researcher at [DST Group] and as an analyst at [Gapmaps]. My interests are in health analytics and machine learning and I also enjoy occasionally tinkering with open data.
