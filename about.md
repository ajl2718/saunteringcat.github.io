I am a Data Scientist currently working in government in Melbourne, Australia with a background in Mathematics and Physics. I completed my PhD in Statistical Mechanics in 2015 at the [University of Melbourne](https://www.ms.unimelb.edu.au), then worked as a Researcher at [DST Group]. I also worked as a kind of analyst / programmer at [Gapmaps], a geospatial consultancy in Melbourne.
