I am currently a Research Fellow in Cancer Services and Data Science at the University of Melbourne. My research focuses on applications of machine learning and statistical methods to linked health services data in order to improve cancer survivorship.

This blog is less related to my academic research activities and more to general tech, programming and data topics, though with some overlap. It is really just a place to record bits and pieces of things I have learnt about in the world of data. I find it useful to write up what I learn about in order to test and clarify my own understanding and hopefully some of these articles will be useful for others too. 

My background is in maths and physics and I completed my PhD in the area of Statistical Mechanics back in 2015. Since then I have gained a fairly broad range of experiences across the data world: previously I have worked as a Data Scientist at [VCDI] leading various data science projects involving government data challenges; a signal processing researcher at [DST Group] and as an analyst at [Gapmaps]. My main interests are in health analytics, machine learning and statistics, but I also enjoy occasionally tinkering with open data.

A couple of open source projects I have led:

- [Loupe]: a package for identifying and redacting Personally Identifiable Information (PII) in free-text. PII is a common barrier to data sharing in many different domains so the aim of this project is to have an open source solution that is generally applicable but also can be trained for more specific corpora.

- [PhraseGeocoder]: A geocoding package for Australian street addresses, using Python and PostgreSQL, based on some fairly modern record linkage techniques.


I also enjoy mountains, cooking eggplant, reading and music.
